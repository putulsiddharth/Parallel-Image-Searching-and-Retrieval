# Parallel-Image-Searching-and-Retrieval

In this project we are going to take a set of images as in input form and extracting the features vectors in a parallel fashion using multiple threads. Then we export these resultant feature vectors of all images to an excel sheet. Now a query image is taken and in order to obtain the similar image, its feature vector is matched with the feature vector present in excel sheet which in return show the required result. This is similar to the one we do in the web browser where we input our elements and the browser searches for the similar one in his record and present the same. We are going to implement this project using MATLAB. As it has emerged as one of the powerful language used for technical computing. Parallel computing with MATLAB has an interactive environment which provide high performance computing procedures and helps to present the output in an efficient and designed way.
